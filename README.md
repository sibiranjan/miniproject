# Diet Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project aims to provide personalized diet recommendations based on the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) using machine learning algorithms such as K-Means Clustering and Random Forest.

## Introduction
Maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall well-being. However, finding the right balance of nutrients and caloric intake can be challenging. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze individual BMI and provide tailored diet suggestions.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

## Usage
1. Run the `simple.py` script:
2. Input your personal details including height, weight, age, and gender.
3. The system will calculate your BMI and recommend a diet plan based on the machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Utilized for segmenting users into different BMI groups.
2. **Random Forest**: Predicts suitable food recommendations based on the user's BMI group.

## Data
The dataset used for training the machine learning models includes:
- Height
- Weight
- Age
- Gender
- Food preferences
- BMI

## Features
- Personalized diet recommendations.
- User-friendly interface.
- Easily extendable with additional machine learning models or dietary guidelines.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with fitness trackers for real-time BMI updates.
- Incorporating user feedback to improve recommendations.
- Enhanced visualization of nutritional information.
